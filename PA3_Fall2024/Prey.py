        # Requirements:
        #   1. Your creatures should always stay within the fixed size 3D "tank". You should do collision detection
        #   between the creature and the tank walls. When it hits the tank walls, it should turn and change direction to stay
        #   within the tank.
        #   2. Your creatures should have a prey/predator relationship. For example, you could have a bug being chased
        #   by a spider, or a fish eluding a shark. This means your creature should react to other creatures in the tank.
        #       1. Use potential functions to change its direction based on other creaturesâ€™ location, their
        #       inter-creature distances, and their current configuration.
        #       2. You should detect collisions between creatures.
        #           1. Predator-prey collision: The prey should disappear (get eaten) from the tank.
        #           2. Collision between the same species: They should bounce apart from each other. You can use a
        #           reflection vector about a plane to decide the after-collision direction.
        #       3. You are welcome to use bounding spheres for collision detection.

    def animationUpdate(self):
        ##### TODO 2: Animate your creature!
        # Requirements:
        #   1. Set reasonable joints limit for your creature
        #   2. The linkages should move back and forth in a periodic motion, as the creatures move about the vivarium.
        #   3. Your creatures should be able to move in 3 dimensions, not only on a plane.
        # create periodic animation for creature joints

        pass
        ##### BONUS 6: Group behaviors
        # Requirements:
        #   1. Add at least 5 creatures to the vivarium and make it possible for creatures to engage in group behaviors,
        #   for instance flocking together. This can be achieved by implementing the
        #   [Boids animation algorithms](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) of Craig Reynolds.
